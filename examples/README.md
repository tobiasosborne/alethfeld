# Examples

This folder contains example proofs generated by Alethfeld. They are intended to demonstrate the system's capabilities and output format—not to serve as verified mathematical results.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**These proofs have not been fully verified by a human mathematician.**

The EDN and LaTeX outputs may contain errors. The Lean 4 files are unverified and should be regarded as untrusted—they may not compile, may contain incorrect formalizations, or may have `sorry` markers that hide significant gaps.

These examples show what the system *produces*, not what it *guarantees*.

## Example 1: Dobinski's Formula

**Theorem:** The Bell numbers satisfy
$$B_n = \frac{1}{e} \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{k^n}{k!}$$

**Why this example:** A classical result in combinatorics connecting Bell numbers (counting set partitions) to an infinite series. The proof requires careful handling of series manipulation and combinatorial identities. This serves as a baseline test—a well-known result that any competent system should handle.

## Example 2: Determinant of Prime Number Matrix

**Source:** [arXiv:2512.20684](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20684) — "Remark on a determinant involving prime numbers" (Huan Xiao, December 2025)

**Theorem:** A determinant formula for matrices involving prime numbers, shown to be a special case of a known linear algebra identity unrelated to primality.

**Why this example:** This paper appeared in December 2025, well after Claude's training cutoff. Alethfeld discovered a proof using a different approach than the paper—demonstrating that the system can find alternative proof paths rather than merely regurgitating memorized proofs.

- `prime-determinant/proof.tex` — LaTeX output
- `prime-determinant/proof.lean` — Lean 4 (unverified)

**Note:** The Alethfeld proof strategy differs from the paper's approach.

## Example 3: Erdős–Herzog–Piranian Lemniscate Lemma

**Source:** [arXiv:2512.12455](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12455) — "The maximal length of the Erdős–Herzog–Piranian lemniscate length in high degree" (December 2025)

**Theorem:** Lemma 3.1(i) from the paper, concerning lemniscates of monic polynomials.

**Background:** The Erdős–Herzog–Piranian conjecture states that among monic polynomials of degree $n$, the maximal arclength of the lemniscate $\{z \in \mathbb{C} : |p(z)| = 1\}$ is attained by $p(z) = z^n - 1$. The paper establishes this for sufficiently large $n$.

**Why this example:** A technical lemma from current research in complex analysis. Tests the system's ability to handle a specific sub-result from a larger proof, with precise hypotheses and conclusions.

## Example 4: Random Purification Channel

**Source:** [arXiv:2511.23451](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23451) — "Random purification channel made simple" (November 2025)

**Theorem:** A lemma concerning the random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of a mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of purifications.

**Background:** The random purification channel has become an important tool in quantum learning theory. The cited paper provides a simplified construction that makes the channel's properties transparent.

**Why this example:** A result from quantum information theory—a domain requiring careful handling of operator algebras, tensor products, and probabilistic constructions. Tests whether the system can navigate the formalism of quantum mechanics without introducing the subtle errors common in this area.

## How to Read These Examples

Each proof is in three formats:

### EDN (`.edn`)
The primary structured format. Human-readable but designed for machine processing. Key elements:
- `:theorem` — The statement being proved
- `:symbols` — Type declarations for mathematical objects
- `:assumptions` — Explicit hypotheses
- `:steps` — Hierarchical Lamport-style proof steps
- `:qed` — Final step assembling the proof

### LaTeX (`.tex`)
Publication-ready output. Compile with `pdflatex`. Uses Lamport-style step numbering (⟨1⟩1, ⟨2⟩1, etc.) with explicit justifications.

### Lean 4 (`.lean`)
**Unverified.** May not compile. May not correctly formalize the mathematics. `sorry` markers indicate gaps. Provided only to show the system's output—not as trusted formalization.

## Verification Status

| Example | Prover-Verifier Rounds | Admitted Steps | Human Verified |
|---------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Dobinski | 23 | 0 | ❌ |
| Prime Determinant | 31 | 1 | ❌ |
| Lemniscate | 28 | 2 | ❌ |
| Random Purification | 34 | 1 | ❌ |

"Admitted steps" are gaps explicitly acknowledged by the system. "Human Verified" would indicate a mathematician has checked the proof—none of these have been verified.

## Contributing Verified Examples

If you verify one of these proofs (or find errors), please open an issue or PR. Particularly valuable:
- Confirmation that the mathematical content is correct
- Identification of subtle errors the Verifier missed
- Lean 4 files that actually compile and typecheck

## Reproducing These Examples

To regenerate any example:

```bash
claude --max-turns 100 < orchestrator-prompt.md
```

Then provide the theorem statement. Note that results may vary between runs—the system is not deterministic.
