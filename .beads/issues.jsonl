Update all Claude Code skills to use the compiled version (`./scripts/alethfeld`) instead of the slow `clojure -M:run` approach.\n\n**Motivation:**\n- `./scripts/alethfeld` = 1.1s startup (67% faster)\n- `clojure -M:run` = 3.3s startup\n- Significant UX improvement for interactive Claude Code workflows\n\n**Skills to Update:**\nFound in `.claude/commands/*.md`:\n1. **validate-graph.md** - 3 invocations to update\n2. **add-node.md** - 2 invocations to update\n3. **update-status.md** - 1 invocation to update\n4. **init-graph.md** - 3 invocations to update\n5. **extract-lemma.md** - 4 invocations to update\n6. **stats.md** - 1 invocation to update\n\n**Pattern to Replace:**\nOLD:\n```bash\ncd /home/tobiasosborne/Projects/alethfeld/alethfeld \u0026\u0026 clojure -M:run \u003ccommand\u003e [options]\n```\n\nNEW:\n```bash\ncd /home/tobiasosborne/Projects/alethfeld/alethfeld \u0026\u0026 ./scripts/alethfeld \u003ccommand\u003e [options]\n```\n\n**Tasks:**\n- [ ] Update validate-graph.md (replace 3 instances of clojure -M:run with ./scripts/alethfeld)\n- [ ] Update add-node.md (replace 2 instances)\n- [ ] Update update-status.md (replace 1 instance)\n- [ ] Update init-graph.md (replace 3 instances)\n- [ ] Update extract-lemma.md (replace 4 instances)\n- [ ] Update stats.md (replace 1 instance)\n- [ ] Test each skill in Claude Code to verify it works\n- [ ] Optionally add note about 3x speed improvement in descriptions\n\n**Success criteria:**\n- All 14 invocations updated to use ./scripts/alethfeld\n- All skills still work as expected\n- Performance is noticeably faster\n- No `clojure -M:run` references remain in .claude/commands/ ","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-30T21:34:33.068461418+01:00","created_by":"tobiasosborne","updated_at":"2025-12-30T22:43:25.676384127+01:00","closed_at":"2025-12-30T22:43:25.676384127+01:00","close_reason":"Updated 6 skill files (14 total replacements) and 2 doc files to use ./scripts/alethfeld.
